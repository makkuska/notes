====== GIS Project ======
Created Pondělí 17 říjen 2011

===== System components: =====
[*] Operating system: GNU/Linux Ubuntu
[*] Database: PostgreSQL		
[*] DB Spatial Extension: PostGIS
[*] Web server: Apache
[*] Map server: Geoserver (+JRE)
[ ] Visualization: OpenLayers + ExtJS → GeoExt	!!!
[ ] Programming lang.: Javascript, PHP, HTML, CSS, XML
[*] Desktop GIS: QuantumGIS	

===== Tasks: =====
[*] Installation + setup
[*] Data selection and loading to DB (QGIS, shp2pg) (Hungarian EOV EPSG:23700)
[*] Map composition and styling (Geoserver, SLD, OpenLayers)
[ ] Viewer customization (GeoExt, HTML, PHP?): Map, Layers, Legend, Tools
[ ] Extra features: uploading user data from file (tracklog), create user contents (POIs with photos), geotools (selection, buffer, network), download (kml)

===== Milestones: =====
Please write here some date with expected results…
[*] 3. October 2011: DB + Geoserver is installed, configured	
[*] 14. October 2011: Vector dataset is loaded into the DB, Geoserver is tested
[*] 18. October 2011 : SLD Styling, Creating layer groups
[ ] ……………….	……………….

===== Results: =====
* Running DB and web services
* Customized web interface for visualization of geodata (using GeoExt)
* Some extra tools → 16. December 2011
* Project documentation (10-15 pages) → 20. January 2012

===== Links & Books =====
* 1) PostGIS in Action (link)
	* You can read the whole book, but I think, it will be enough: Part 3 / Chapter 11 and Chapter 12.3
* 2) OpenGeo Tutorials with data
	* Introduction to GeoServer http://workshops.opengeo.org/geoserver-intro/ -> SLD Styling http://workshops.opengeo.org/geoserver-intro/styling/index.html#geoserver-styling
	* Introduction to OpenLayers http://workshops.opengeo.org/openlayers-intro/
	* Developing OGC Compliant Web Applications with GeoExt http://workshops.opengeo.org/geoext/
	* Spatial Database Tips and Tricks → extra tools (?) http://workshops.opengeo.org/postgis-spatialdbtips/
* 3) Openlayers Examples http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/
* 4) GeoExt Examples http://geoext.org/examples.html

===== Data =====
* Vector data have to be uploaded to the DB. All data have Hungarian EOV coordinates, but you have to check and define it in QGIS, EPSG:23700.
* Raster data should be converted to other raster format (that Geoserver can handle), might be… :)

Don’t forget, max. (and min.) 5 hours per week! :) I hope, you can use this work in your bsc thesis… And if you have any questions…
