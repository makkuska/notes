====== The evolution of the Tisza ======
Created Čtvrtek 15 prosinec 2011

Tisza. There is no one other river, which sometimes by its majestic loop, sometimes with its unmanageable run would be engraved itself so deep into the heart of the Hungarian people. The proverb says: "Who drinks the water of the Tisza, longs to be back there." This can be true, because the unique feeling of the river has touched the soul of Sándor Petőfi and Gyula Juhász, two of our great poets, but the beauty of the blond Tisza, its ribbon, accompanied by tide forests, the mysterious inhabitants of its mortlakes has been preserved in many songs and tales by the people living here too. It is sayd, the Tisza is mild and capricious like a woman, so one must not treat it else: it should be loved, but it should be protected as well, so that its water could refresh who come after us, its fishes could nourish our grandchildren, and so that their soul could find home in the peaceful Tisza scene.

In order to understand the river indeed, it is indispensable to get acquainted with its evolution, development, environment and its relations to man. We have an opportunity for this on the following pages.

===== The evolution of the Tisza =====

The Tisza catchment area, the path of the rivers has been formed and shaped to the recent form by external and internal surface forming factors, i. e. on one hand tectonical movements and volcanic activity, on the other hand water and wind.

The beginning of the formation of the Tisza water regime in a narrow sense falls on the end of the tertiary, about 1,5 million years ago. In the pliocene epoch due to the rise of massifs in more phases, a close basin has been formed in the territory of Hungary, the Pannonian sea, which at the end of the epoch has been gradually silted up. That time waters from the north and north-eastern Carpathians headed for the deepest point of the Pannonian basin on the line of the recent Ér and Berettyó, and through the medium of the Ancient Maros valley, waters of the Transsylvanian basin and the Bihar mountains have flown here too. In the pleistocene epoch formation of the Tisza bed has been determined mainly by local tectonic changes. An important phase is the moderate sinking of the Bodrogköz-Szatmás plane and the stronger rise of Nyírség, is the consequence of which the river left the Ér-Berettyó-Körös route, its path has pushed northwards, and was forced to a north-western bend at the north edge of the Great plane (Alföld). Its further route at the borders of Hortobágy-Kunság and Borsod-Heves-Jazygia (-Jászság) has been marked out also by sinks. During these changes in the bed Tisza has crossed its right bank tributaries and has broken up into more branches. Its water has flown on partly in the old bad of its tributaries, partly in the new bed marked out by the sinks. From the reach south from Tokaj many branches lead in the left old beds towards the Sárrét depression.

 Recent water regime of Tisza, which has not already beared marks of human influence, presumably has formed as follows. The river, arriving to the plain, has turned north at the Szamos outlet, later after making a 50-60 km route, at Záhony it has changed direction again, it has continued its way west-south-westwards, it has passed round Tokaj hill and around Tiszaluc, along the alluvial cones of Sajó and Hernád it has turned southwards. Lower down it has meandered at the Heves plane, and around Csongrád it has turned south again. On this section according to the lower reaches of the right bank tributaries and changes of local sinkings, more smaller branches have broken out from its body. Branches braking out below the Tokaj gate have reached the Körös basin through the Hortobágy, Berettyó, Zádor, Kakat, Mirhó, Büdös-ér and Nagy-Hék. Right side tributaries has shown a similar sight, they have also breaked into more branches feeding more streams. These covered the whole territory with a network. That time both right and left side tributaries had a greater water output, i. e. large number of streams abunding in water was characteristic to the region.
 
Reaching the Great plain, losing its relief energy in a very short time Tisza is forced to deposit its slit, creating series of alluvial cones. Recently the Hungarian part of the river's catchment area is divided by three major alluvial cones into five parts. The alluvial cone of the Nyírség is being enclosed between the upper Tisza bed (Kraszna, Szamos, Túr) and the water regime of Körös-Berettyó. The Bükk hillfoot alluvial cone divides the valleys of Sajó-Bódva-Hernád from the waters of the Zagyva-Tarna. Finally the Maros alluvial cone separates the Maros valley from the Körös catchment area. Further consequence of the gentle slope is, that the river runs towards its erosion base with large roundabouts, curves. Coming out to the Great plane, Tisza is a meandering river of middle course character. Its route is accompanied by cut windings, i. e. mortlakes, belt-shallows created by floods. So there are continuous changes in the geological present too. The bed is continuously changing by wandering and cuttong windings.

===== Recent changes, human influence =====

Earliest traces of human influence are from the copper age. A more significant transformation of the landscape appears from the 5th century A. D., the remains of which are drainage-protective ditches, trenches and mounds, and the also multifunctional fishgarths. People of that age, by strengthening natural resources applied tide lands to their own use probably with a considerablely favourable efficiency, i. e. they produced their goods with low cost, without decreasing natural resources. They linked left beds on tide lands with semistatic or ephemerous waters, creating a unified water regime. Annual floods provided the base of agriculture. Floods inundated lower elevation areas through cuttings made on natural high banks accompanying the river, and the flood went back to the parent bed through these cuts. Since flood happened from below, the major part of alluvial deposits was set down even at the cuttings, which were maintained by regular dredging. Therefore water management was made not by quick drainage of the flood, but by regulated spreading of it. Utilization was wide range, including fishing, animal husbandry, agriculture and fruit growing too. This complex utilization system is called tide land, or cutting farming. It should be emphasized, that the character of tide land farming basically differs from the present day method, considering that it was based not on using up natural resources, much rather on strengthening them. Its other important feature is, that in tide land farming tilling of arable land was only to a smaller extent, acting a subsidary role. In the course of tide land utilizations melioration works considerablely transformed the original, ancient physiognomy of the landscape, actually since that time the character of the tide land was decisively determided by human influence. Tide land farming went into a decline in the 15-16th century, the first moments of which were the clogging of cuttings and ditches. We can speak about the large scale swamping of the Tisza valley only since that time. Probably the most important reasons of relatively quick changes beside demographic sides were large scale decrease of the proportion of tide forests (both at the spring region and on the plane), and increasing number of artificial dams due to the appearance of watermills.

 
Large scale meliorations, the result of which determine the hydrogeographic image of the Tisza valles even till toway, have started in the middle of the 19th century. Control works aimed primarily building of flood-prevention embankments and cutting out windings in order to drain floods as soon as possible. Works have been started with the management of Széchenyi, using the plans of Vásárhelyi, more correctly in the first part of the century mainly using those of Mátyás Huszár. It must be noticed, that that time more experts were of the opinion, that tides of the river are not necessary to prevent, only to limit, or rather they insisted on creating a control system based on spreadig over the floods. The starting point of the large scale landscape transforming work was marked by the foundation of the Tiszavölgyi Company in 1846. The first cut has been made in the region of Tiszadob in 27. August 1846. All subsequent phases of the river control can be linked to larger floods. Besides the Tisza the control of its tributaries has also begun. Definitive work has been made on the Szamos only after 1890. During the control works 36 windings have been cut through, and with a 1300 m short cut a new mouth of more favourable direction has been shaped, about 2,5 km below the old one. In consequence of the water management of that time drying of the Great plane has started, and the appearing of inland waters has called that irrigation and inland water drainage channel network into being, the works of which has started in the 1930's, and finished about in the 1950's, but the maintenance and developement of which lasts continuously today.

===== Structure of the Tisza catchment area =====

Tisza belongs to the Danube catchment area. 157 thousand km2 in extension, the Tisza catchment area is bordered by the Carpathians in the north-west to south-east, while the dividing is quite low to the west and south-west. The area is divided in the middle by the Transsylvanian island range, to the east of which the Transsylvanian basin, to the west the the Great plane is situated. In the deep path of the latter runs the middle and lower Tisza roughly following a north-south direction.
 
The river has its source in the north-eastern part of the catchment area, in the Máramaros mountains. Irs two branches, the Black Tisza, taking its source in 1680 m elevation in the foot of Szvidovec, and the White Tisza taking its source in 1600 m elevation embraces the 2058 m high peak of Hoverla. The united Tisza keeps the roughly north-south direction of Black Tisza, as far as the stream in of the left side Visó (Vişeu), which in turn is the first tribitary of significant size. Tisza turns from here west, and after doing a 26 km way takes up Iza, which has its source also in the Radna mountains. Tisza follows the break line determining the south-east - north-west direction of Iza at the foot of the Avas mountains (M. Oaşului) which makes the precursor of Lápos (M. Ţibleşului) and Gutin (M. Gutîiului) range. Between Avas and the right bank Nagyszőlősi mountains (Vinogradov), in the Huszt gate the water of the river suddenly widens, and before reaching the edge of the Great plain it takes up Tarac (Tereva), Talabor (Tereblja) and Nagyág (Rika) coming from the right bank. Between Királyháza and the Szamos mouth the river follows an east-western direction. On this section it receives two larger tributaries; Borsát (Borava) from the right and Túr from the left already on Hungarian terrain. Until the inflow of Szamos the catchment area enlarges to 13173 km2. On the 258 km way doing as far as here its elevation decreases to 103 m, i. e. the decline of the river on its upper course is 1577 m. The upper course of the river, which can be divided hydrologically into upper, middle and lower course, lasts until the Szamos mouth. The border of the middle and lower course is given by the Maros inflow.

The Szamos river at CsengerThe secound largest tributary of the Tisza is Szamos (Someş). From its 415 km total length only 50 km falls inside the current Hungarian border. The river holds up waters of the northern part of the Transsylvanian basin. One of its two main branches is Nagy-Szamos (Someşul-Mare) accompanying the Radnai mountains to the south, the other is Kis-Szamos (Someşul-Mic), which originates from the union of Meleg-Szamos (Someşul-Cald), taking its source in the Transsylvanian island range, on the eastern slope of the Bihar mountains (M. Bihorului), and Hideg-Szamos (Someşul-Rece), which springs in the Gyalu mountains (M. Gilăului). The spring of the Nagy-Szamos is situated in 1558 m elevation, while Meleg-Szamos starts in 1358 m, Hideg-Szamos in 1683 m elevation. Until the union the length of Nagy-Szamos is 119.6 km, the expansion of its catchment area is 5034 km2. Its main tributary is Sajó (Şieu), and Beszterce (Bistriţa) flowing into the Sajó. Kis-Szamos collects the water of a 3804km2area. Its tributary is Füzes (Fizeş) flowing in near the union with Nagy-Szamos. United Szamos has two larger tributaries. One of them is Almás (Almaş), the other is Lápos (Lăpuş), which takes its source in Lápos and Gutin mountains. The total catchment area of Szamos is 15882km2, which hence is larger then that of the receiving Tisza. Therefore it is conspicuous, that the water output of the Szamos is 134 m3/s by the average of many years, while at its inflow Tisza brings 203 m3/s water. The reason of this is, that the catchment area of the Szamos, in consequence of being enclosed by high mountains, is much shorter of precipitation, than the spring region of the Tisza. The mean descent of the bed is 16 m/km on the mountain course, 0.64 m/km on the Romanian lowland course, while about 0.22 m/km on the Hungarian lowland course.
 
Kraszna, feeding the former Ecsed moor, was flowing into the Szamos until the 1890's. Its lower course has been removed in such way, that now it flows directly into the Tisza about 3.5 km below the Szamos mouth. From the Kraszna mouth Tisza turns north, going round the barely 170 m high Nyírség sand ridge, and it reaches its northernmost point at Záhony. Here it takes its route west-south-west with a sharp bend, it takes up Lónya main channel from the left, which collects the Nyírség waters, and in the foot of the Tokaj Kopasz hill, 544 km from its mouth it takes up its most important right bank tributary Bodrogot.
 
Showing the Tisza and its catchment area the most important artificial stream of the Great plane water network, Eastern main channel should be mentioned, which branches out from the Tisza at Tiszalök.
 
The flow of the Tisza is directrd south-westwards from the inflow of Bodrog. It follows the Taktaköz sinking, and on the south edge of that it takes up Sajó, increased by Hernád, also from the right. Waters of the Bükk mountains get into the Tisza through an old Tisza bed, the Small Tisza.
 
By damming up the section between Kisköre and Tiszavalk (441.0-403.2 river kilometres) Tisza Lake has been made within the foreshore of the Tisza, which with its 127 km2 extension has become the secound largest stagnant water of the Carpathian basin. Damming was enabled by putting the Kisköre barrage into operation in 1973. The aim of the investment was the complex ecogeographical reconstruction of the mid Tisza valley, the improvement of natural an d social relationships.
 
The next tributary of the Tisza is Zagyva, the main drain of waters of Mátra and Cserhát mounts, coming also from the right bank. After the Zagyva mouth the river turns south, and keeps this direction parallel to the Danube even until the mouth. It is accompanied by the sand ridge between the Danube and the Tisza to the west, from where it does not get any significant water. However, the next left side tributary Triple Körös is quite important, the catchment of which is the escound largest (27537 km2) among the tributaries. Its network consists of five rivers spreading like a fan: Fehér- (White), Fekete- (Black), Sebes- (Rapid) Körös, and Berettyó and Hortobágy-Berettyó, the first four of which are fed by waters of the Transsylvanian island range, while the last one drains waters of the plains beyond the Tisza. The most important water last flowing into the Tisza on the territory of Hungary is Maros, which catches the waters of the southern part of the Transsylvanian basin from a 30332 km2 area. At the esction below the Maros the western edge of the dividing approaches the Danube at Baja. On this section Tisza takes up only two rivers, which tekr their source in Romania, but both of which reach the Tisza in Yugoslavia. These are Aranka of lowland character, and Béga, flowing 9.6 km from the Danube mouth. Finally Tisza reaches its recipient, the Danube at Titel on the territory of the present Yugoslavia.

 Stagnant waters accompanying the Tisza

Outlining the geographical features of the Tisza valley, stagnant waters accompanying the river should anyway be mentioned. These are partly temporary or permanent waters of plains and left beds coming into existence in tectonic sinkings, or foreshore or protected side mortlakes coming into existence naturally or artificially by cutting out windings. Fish ponds and water reservoird of different purpose, established in the low oarts of the tide land belong also here. Many enclosed valleys can be seen can be seen on the mountain coures too, and many reservoires have been made serving flood protection or as industrial and municipal water supply. Number and size of natural stagnant waters on its catchment area is not significant.
 
Number of dead beds by the Tisza is 149 in Hungary, their total surface is almost 3000 ha. These freshwater habitats as refugees play an important role in sustaining the aquatic or water linked plant and animal life of the Tisza valley becoming dryer. Their valuable vegetation and fauna makes them especially important from the viewpoint of nature conservation. Most important among them are mortlakes of so called "temple" character, which are under the protection of nature conservation. On the upper Tisza such a place is the Helmecszeg Dead Tisza (Tarpa), or the Boroszlókert Dead Tisza (Gulács), the Herep Dead Tisza (Tiszacsege), or the Mártély Dead Tisza (Hódmezővásárhely). Their utilization aims mostly recreation or fishing - Nagy-morotva, (Big mortlake at Rakamaz), Vargaszeg Dead TIsza (Tarpa), Marótzug Dead Tisza (Gávavencsellő), Tunyogmatolcs Dead Tisza (Tunyogmatolcs) - and they also serve as water supplies for agriculture or industry, e. g. Alcsisziget Dead Tisza (Szolnok).
 
Among fish ponds the most important are the Hortobágy fishlakes, the total surface of which is almost 6000 ha, and the one near Szeged, the most noteble member of which is the Szeged Fehér tó (White Lake) - and the Biharugra fishlakes vith an also more thousand hectares extension. Among water reservoirs on the whole length of the Tisza with its size the most striking is the above mentioned Tisza Lake, the extension of which is 127 km2, but we should mention the Szabolcsveresmart reservoir on the upper Tisza, flood protection reservoirs (of Kunkápolnás and Füredkócs) on the mid course on the Hortobágy, which has been formed from the old beds of the Tisza - now serving nature conservation purposes as well, or the two reservoirs of irigation purpose along the Eastern main channel. There are mortlakes and reservoirs of different purposes in large number on the lowland areas of the river disannexed from Hungary, on the Southern region, on the Highland region, in the Mezőség and within the Transsylvanian basin too. The most important of these are Záh lake (Lacul Zau) in Mezőség, Cege lake (Ţaga Mare) on the Füzes brook, the Ungszenna (Senné) lakes on the Highlands, and Palics lake near Szabadka (Subotica) and the Melence (Melenci) Ruszand lake. Fish ponds of significant extension have been made in Romania and Slovakia too.

 On the mountain course on the Slovakian part more dam lakes and 35 smaller natural stagnant waters can be found. The most important among these are Vihorlát reservoir (Zemplínska írava) made for the repression of flood peaks of Laborc with its 3000 ha extension, and Ondava Nagydomása reservoir (Vežka Domaa) with 1400 ha. In addition to the lakes of Mezőség on Romanian territories mentioned above, mountain lakes originated from glacial hollows of Radna, Szeben and Szörény mountains, and lakes of the south Transsylvanian salt basin are worthy of mention. The major part of these does not rich even a 1 ha extension.
 

===== Geographic features of the Tisza catchment area =====

The route of the Tisza and its tributaries was determined primarily by geographical features of the catchment area before melioration. River control influenced the effect of these significantly. The formation and the size of the bed is determined by the decline of their valley and the material of that, and by the water output, but by dams and flood protection embankments, now the river has lost its natural character on its lowland course, its hydrologic characteristics are mainly under the influence of artificial objects.
 
On the spring region of the Tisza in its vallies of 20-50 m/km decline we can hardly speak about a bed. After larger rainfalls flood runs through the valley bottom on its whole width, while in dry weather water gurgles only on the stairs made by the rocky bottom and hides between huge rock-glaciers. Below the union of the Black and the White Tisza we can speak about a wild mountain brook abounding in water, which already has a shallow bed. The stoney bed is succeeded by the large size gravel. From the inflow of the Visó the original water output doubles, and at the same time the decline of the bed decreases to 2 m/km. Here the bed is a few decimetres deep, with gravelly bottom, the river meanders among islands and gravel shoals, continuously changing its rout. Below the influx of Borsa the decline of the bed further decreases, and together with this the gravelly bed material changes about the size of hazelnuts, and waters flowing between wide gravel shelfs, divided in branches up to this point, continue their way in a capriciously winding, but united bed. The river reaching to the Great plain runs in a deep bed. Its decline decreases quickly, in the hight of the Szamos mouth it shows a value around 8.8 cm/km and vetween Kisköre and the mouth it decreases from 3,7 cm/km to 2,5 cm/km. The river bed coming into the country is small grained gravel and which changes till the Szamos mouth into fine grained sand. Mud and clay appears and becomes higher and higher in proportion from the mouth of Bodrog towards the lower course. On the Tisza lowland the river bed changes more or less around 200 m wide, however in certain sections it is only half of that or even less (at Szolnok: 95 m), while elsewhere it becomes 300 m or at Zemplénagérd 420 m wide. It should be mentioned here, that flood protetcion embankments on the lowland course are 1400-1800 m wide in average, but in many places they are less than the half of the average, so in the region of Martfű they are only 205 m wide. Winding is a characteristic feature of the lowland course. A nice example of meandering can be seen on the upper course, where till the mouth of Borsa original conditions can be seen, while below that due to the bed froming ability of the river, it made extremely numerous windings since the control works. Below Dombrád this sight changes, because the material of the valley becomes more resistant and the decline of the river decreases. Flat curves of wider arch are characteristic to this course.
 
Among natural froces shaping the water regime of the Tisza temperature and precipitation relations and outflow characteristics are basic. The Tisza catchment area has a temperate continental climate. This general image is modified by meso- and micriclimatic factors, such as modifying effect of the relief, exposition and vegetation of the given place.
 
Téli Tisza Zsurknál In general mean annual temperature is 10-11 °C on the lowland parts of the Tisza catchment area, while 8-9 °C within the Transsylvanian basin, and 6-9 °C on middle elevation mountains. Averages of many years, however do not reflect the real face of the climate of the catchment area. Mean annual temperature values themself show a 3-4 degrees of fluctuatuon, but differences are significantly greater considering certain months, which can exceed 10 degrees differences as well. Of course the largest differences are from the temperature extremities. Thus the greatest value of the fluctuation of the temperature is 70 degrees (max. 41.3 °C; min. -32.2 °C), which proves the continental character of the climate.
 
A Tisza hullámtere kisvizes időszakban The Tisza catchment area is poor in precipitation. About 60% of the upper river gets more than 1000 mm precioitation annually. The valley of the Black Tisza is in the shadow of the Hoverla, and the annual precipitation does not exceed 1200-1300 mm at the spring region of the White Tisza. Compared to their high elevation the valleys of Visó and Iza are definitely dry. West of the Huszt (Khust) gate, coming out to the Great plane, the river gets a rapidly decreasing amount of precipitation, and this stays below 600 mm per year everywhere on the Tisza lowland.

 The catchment area of the Szamos is essentially poorer in precipitation than that of the Upper Tisza. The Spring region is on a place definitely sheltered from the rain mainly thanks to the east-western direction of the Radna mountains, which is the spring region of the Greater Szamos, and the Bihar mountains, which is that of the Lesser Szamos. At the junction of the two river branches, in the heart of the Transsylvanian basin, the amount of the mean annual precioitation does not exceed 600 mm. On the further route of the river from the direction of the Gutin a region, more rich in rains, links to the catchment, which is characterized by 1263 mm of Kapnikbánya (Cavnic) and 953 mm of Nagybánya (Baia Mare).

 Hullámtéri puhafa-ligeterdő Distribution of the precipitation within a year is worthy of attention. Since on the whole catchment area temperate continental climate is a dominating factor, early summer precipitation maximum is characteristic. About 25 % of the annual precipitation falls in May and June. This image is modified by the air currents of the Mediterranean Sea, in consequence of which the summer precipitation maximum is being completed with a secoundary autumn maximum around October-November. Annual distribution of precipitation therefore is quite uneven; it can be characterized by two peaks and a dry season between them. Distribution of precioitation of the mountain courses is greatly influenced by the relief, here it is more balanced to a certain extent. Significant differences show also in distribution of precipitation of certain years, which is not only the characteristic feature of the last decades in this region.

 Felső-tiszai hullámtéri hagyásfás gyep hajnalban The other important element of the water regime is evaporation. Relative humidity on the Tisza catchment area is 80-85 % in the winter months, and 60-65 % in summer. On the Great plane in the summer months - primarily around noon - humidity decreases even on 40 %. From a hydrological point of view evaporizing capacity of the atmosphere is very important, which shows the potential maximum of evaporation. The real value of evaporation stays below the possible values on the lowland areas poorer in precipitation, but in part within the Transsylvanian basin too, the reason of which is, that evaporation exhausts water reservoir of the soil. Assuming the relationship of the potential evaporizing capacity and precipitation the received image well represents the arid character of the Tisza catchment area. According to these annual evaporation on the Great plane exceeds annual precipitation even in mean annual amounts, namely on significant part of the territories beyond the Tisza in a measure exceedind 40 %. Total water deficit of the vegetation period (April to September) on the Great plain reaches 160-180 mm.
 
Tiszapart kisvíznélÁradás Tiszafürednél Outlining the geographic image of the Tisza catchment area it can be sayd, that the water libration value on the Tisza is quite great, tends to extremities. Beside natural forces this is further strengthened by human influance. Averages of the low level water output between the influx of Szamos and the mouth stay much below 100 m3/s, they can decrease even to a value of 40 m3/s, whlie flood level water output varies around 4000 m3/s. There are significant differences between water outputs of certain years too. By the evidence of the annual data 10-15 year long wet and dry periods follow each other in the Tisza valley. Water outputs within a year follow the characteristics of the climate. Tiszai árvíz In general on the territory of the catchment area spring months are the most abundant in water. Floods are quite violent, their drainage is significantly influenced by floods of tributaries. During long lasting rainy periods floods can be congested. It is a peculiarity, that ice-floes are of much less significance on the Tisza, than on the Danube, because in the deep bed piling ice cannot rise water level significantly. Because Tisza is a river of definitely lowland character - the proportion of mountain areas on its cathment area is about 1 %, while those below 200 m is 46 % - and the highest point of the chatchment area (2506 m) is below the permanent snow-line, it is lacking in glacier waters and moraine lakes, which could provide continuous water supply. The amount of outflow is influenced by impermeability of the catchment area too. From this point of view it can be stated, that semipermeable surfaces dominating in the catchment area of the Upper Tisza, the Szamos and the Bodrog are able to moderate violence of floods, and they serve as some reserves in the low water Szakadópart tiszavirágteleppel periods. There is an impermeable surface on the Great plain, and the same thing is characteristic to the Körös region. On these territories this is the main reason of inland waters. After draining the water stored in the snow cover water output decreases rapidly, i. e. water reserves of the river exhaust soon. Low water period appears primarily in summer and in the autumn, mainly between August and October, which state, besides shortage of precipitation, is further worsened by high value of evaporation. Highest low water values have been measured in the last years, due to the deepening of the bed following river control works. Extremities of water libration everywhere reach 8 m, but in extreme cases in some sections water libration reaches 20 m.
