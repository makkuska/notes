* 1-26 slide (I missed because of FieldTrip)
* Human impact - Arpád-Age (896 - 1301)
	* water-dependence: rich fishing waters in artificial water system (lakes, rivers)
	* animal husbandry - they used the lower areas in summer time
	* transportation - it was easy to use boats
	* differentiated landscape → different soils → agriculture used this 
	* built canals - canals had double function 
	* forest cover huge area - forest clearances - orchard, gardens
	* settlement structure:
		* one road to the higher areas → small territories, villages (20-25km2, distance 4-5km one next other)
		* marshes and open water bodies around
		* landuse: quater village (+ vineyards) + quater plough fields + quater pasture + quater wetland (60-75% of a population depends on it)
* Uses of the water:
	* Fishing
		* the most important at that time → exported ex. to England
		* fishing on smaller brooks (=malá říčka), they made a "trups?", so only bigger fish ware caught
		* it existed fishing villages
	* Transportation
		* Along rivers
			* salt transport - only royal boats could do that (Buda, Szeged) - there were tax for changing salt in Buda and Szeged from boats to coaches - rich cities
		* Ferry
			* main crossing towns: Szeged, Szolnok, Tokaj, Csongrád - they have pay for it
		* On streams
			* crevasses, brooks
	* Mills
		* 2 different types: mill on "mill passige?" x mill ships
		* mills :flour, oil, frieze (klobouky z toho materiálu), saw (wood)
		* value of mill was 3-6x higher of a castle
		* 10 000 of mill ships on the Tisza
		* millers were first, who made water regulations by mill passages (thet also made first bridges)
	* Irrigation
		* since the 14th century, they made complex ditch system: irrigation <-> drainage
		* very dense system - in 22km2 was 52 km ditch system (today in same area only 9 km ditches)
		* well designed slope, served as roads
	* Irrigates pastures, anmal husbandry
		* great cow - they are wild, sheeps - long hornes and long hair, cattle, bee
		* main period: Middle Ages (Turkish - animals was important during the wars)
		* market towns: Szeged, Debrecen, Buda
	* Protection
		* when Tatars (Mongols - Tatar invastion 1241-42) came, people in castles could excape, because there was water, which got slower Tatars (swamps)
		* Ottoman Empire (1526-1686) - artificial floods: castles, villages
	* other
		* building material: sticks, mud
		* weaving: rush, furniture
		* orchard: pear, plum (lower water height) → lekvár, palinka
		* hunting, trapping (=pastičky, crab, turtle export to Englang)
